My journey to complete the 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenge.

The environments used have been chosen based on challange and fun factor, not ease of use or simplicity. So instead of two lines in Python, sometimes there are 200+ lines in C :)

Goals:
- get more into linux and it's terminal interface
- refresh knowledge about certain languages
- have fun implementing stuff like when I began programming

Log:
- Day4: get bored of the meticulousness of C, decided that algorithm is what's important -> probably going to stick to python
